TIPS FOR USING THIS THEME

Suckerfish menus:
Suckerfish dropdown menus are incorporated into main navigation bar. To use this feature, set up your Primary links menu so that the menu items have children and the parent items have the “expanded” option selected.

Creating a custom color scheme:
To create your own custom color scheme, on the theme configuration page select "None" under the
"Design" category. Then enter HTML color codes into the various fields of the "Custom color settings" section to set colors for different page elements. If you have the Color Picker module installed and enabled, you can use the javascript color selection widgets in this configuration section.

You may also use the custom color settings in conjunction with the predesigned color schemes, but there may be some incompatibilities. Also, to switch from a custom color scheme to one of the predesigned colors schemes, you should clear out all the custom color fields before saving the configuration.
